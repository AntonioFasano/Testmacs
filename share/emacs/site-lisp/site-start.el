;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Testmacs implements a simple multiple-choice test.
;; The test header lines ask for test ID and student details.
;; Questions are without question-text like: Question N; a), b) c) ... I do not know.
;; The student is given a separate paper-sheet with a test ID and the question text.
;; The test shows a mode line with answered questions and a countdown in minutes.
;; At countdown expiration Emacs exits, saving answers.
;; At predefined times (10 seconds) the answers are saved locally and remotely.
;;
;; Answers are stored locally in the parent of `exam-loc-server-ini' and remotely in `exam-net-course-pt'.  
;; To find the remote share, the file retrived from `exam-loc-server-ini' is used.
;; Emacs performs some actions if detects predefined command filenames in the
;;   remote directory `exam-net-data-pt`. See action for each command filename.
;; Command filename "exit007": Emacs will exit in 10 seconds.
;; Command filename "update007": Emacs updates `site-start.el' with the file `new-site-start.txt'
;; in the remote directory `exam-net-data-pt`. If this file is not found or there is a copy error
;; a non-critical error is displayed until the action succeeds or the command filename is removed.
